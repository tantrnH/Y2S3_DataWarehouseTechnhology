-- Generate a random decimal number between 10 and 100 (exclusive of 101)


-- Generate one random value per row in CUSTOMERS table (testing randomness on multiple rows)


-- Generate a random integer (TRUNC removes decimals) between 10 and 100


-- Check the minimum and maximum customerID in new_cust (used to define the range of valid customer IDs)


-- Generate a random customer ID by replacing yyyy with min ID and xxxx with max ID + 1


-- Retrieve the company name of a randomly selected customer with ID from 1 to 6


-- Retrieve customer ID and company name using a random customer ID within a given range


-- Generate a random freight charge (rounded to 2 decimal places) between RM5.99 and RM99.99

-- Drop the existing new_orders table if it exists


-- Create the new_orders table to store synthetic order data

  -- Unique order ID
  -- Customer who placed the order
  -- Employee handling the order
  -- Date the order was placed
  -- Date the customer requires the order
  -- Date the order was shipped
  -- Shipping method ID
  -- Shipping cost
  -- Primary key constraint
  
-- Drop the existing order sequence if it exists


-- Create a sequence to generate ORDERID values starting from 100001


-- Display current time to track script start


-- Enable DBMS output for debugging

-- Declare a PL/SQL block to generate orders for 10 years (from 01/01/2016 to 31/08/2025)

  -- Starting date of order generation
  -- Ending date

  -- Number of orders to generate for a single day
  -- Order ID (from sequence)
  -- Randomly selected customer ID
  -- Random employee ID (1–9)
  -- Order date = current startDate
  -- Required delivery date = orderDate + 7 days
  -- Shipped date = orderDate + 3 days
  -- Random shipper ID (1–6)
  -- Random freight cost (RM5.99 – RM99.99)

  -- Loop for each day in the date range
  
    -- Generate a random number of orders for the day (22 to 60 orders)
    

    -- Inner loop: generate v_max_orders for the current day
    
      -- Get the next order ID from sequence
      

      -- Generate random customer ID using actual customerID min & max (replace yyyy and xxxx)
      

      -- Generate random employee ID between 1 and 9
      

      -- Assign order date as the current loop date
      

      -- Required date = order date + 7 days
      

      -- Shipped date = order date + 3 days
      

      -- Generate random shipper ID (1–6)
      

      -- Generate random freight charge (RM5.99 – RM99.99)
      

      -- Insert generated order into new_orders table
      

    -- Move to the next day


-- Display time after order generation completes


-- Check how many customer records exist in the new_cust table


-- Count how many unique customers actually placed orders


-- Show order frequency per customer


-- Group the number of customers by how many orders they placed
